   and 2.6.x)
 * Linux version 2.4 on PPC
 * FreeBSD version 7.0RC1 on i386 (may works on FreeBSD 5.x/6.x)
 * OpenBSD version 4.2 on i386

Features:

 * Able to control multiple processes: catch fork events on Linux
 * Read/write bytes to arbitrary address: take care of memory alignment and
   split bytes to cpu word
 * Execution step by step using ptrace_singlestep() or hardware interruption 3
